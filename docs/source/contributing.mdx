## Setup

### Setup pre-commit hooks
- Install pre-commit hooks with `pip install pre-commit`.
- Run `pre-commit install` once to install the hooks, so they will be run on every commit.
- If the hooks introduce changes, they'll be visible with `git diff`. Review them and `git add` them if everything is fine, then re-execute the before commit, it should pass now.
- If you want to manually trigger the hooks, you may do `pre-commit run --all-files`

Now all the pre-commit hooks will be automatically run when you try to commit and if they introduce some changes, you need to re-add the changed files before being able to commit and push.

### Ignore formatting revs
- Run `git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs`. This will make it so that `git blame` is aware of commits that were logged to be solely formatting-related.

## Doc-string syntax

We're following NumPy doc-string conventions with the only notable difference being that we use Markdown instead of Rich text format (RTF) for markup within the doc-strings.

Please see the existing documentation to see how to generate autodocs.

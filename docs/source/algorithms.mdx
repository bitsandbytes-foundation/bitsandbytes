This is an overview of the `bnb.functional` API in `bitsandbytes` that we think would also be useful as standalone entities.

## Using Int8 Matrix Multiplication

For straight Int8 matrix multiplication with mixed precision decomposition you can use ``bnb.matmul(...)``. To enable mixed precision decomposition, use the threshold parameter:

```py
bnb.matmul(..., threshold=6.0)
```

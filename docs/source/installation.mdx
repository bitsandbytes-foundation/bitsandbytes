The Linux build has a minimum glibc version of 2.24.

Use `pip` or `uv` to install the latest release:

```bash
pip install bitsandbytes
```

### Compile from Source[[cuda-compile]]

> [!TIP]
> Don't hesitate to compile from source! The process is pretty straight forward and resilient. This might be needed for older CUDA Toolkit versions or Linux distributions, or other less common configurations.

For Linux and Windows systems, compiling from source allows you to customize the build configurations. See below for detailed platform-specific instructions (see the `CMakeLists.txt` if you want to check the specifics and explore some additional options):

<hfoptions id="source">
<hfoption id="Linux">

To compile from source, you need CMake >= **3.22.1** and Python >= **3.10** installed. Make sure you have a compiler installed to compile C++ (`gcc`, `make`, headers, etc.). It is recommended to use GCC 11 or newer.

For example, to install a compiler and CMake on Ubuntu:

```bash
apt-get install -y build-essential cmake
```

You should also install CUDA Toolkit by following the [NVIDIA CUDA Installation Guide for Linux](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html) guide. The current minimum supported CUDA Toolkit version that we support is **11.8**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitsandbytes-foundation/bitsandbytes.git && cd bitsandbytes/
cmake -DCOMPUTE_BACKEND=cuda -S .
make
pip install -e .   # `-e` for "editable" install, when developing BNB (otherwise leave that out)
```

> [!TIP]
> If you have multiple versions of the CUDA Toolkit installed or it is in a non-standard location, please refer to CMake CUDA documentation for how to configure the CUDA compiler.

</hfoption>
<hfoption id="Windows">

Compilation from source on Windows systems require Visual Studio with C++ support as well as an installation of the CUDA Toolkit.

To compile from source, you need CMake >= **3.22.1** and Python >= **3.10** installed. You should also install CUDA Toolkit by following the [CUDA Installation Guide for Windows](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html) guide from NVIDIA. The current minimum supported CUDA Toolkit version that we support is **11.8**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitsandbytes-foundation/bitsandbytes.git && cd bitsandbytes/
cmake -DCOMPUTE_BACKEND=cuda -S .
cmake --build . --config Release
pip install -e .   # `-e` for "editable" install, when developing BNB (otherwise leave that out)
```

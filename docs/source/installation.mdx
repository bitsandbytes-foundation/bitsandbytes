## CUDA[[cuda]]

`bitsandbytes` is currently only supported on CUDA GPUs for CUDA versions **11.0 - 12.5**. However, there's an ongoing multi-backend effort under development, which is currently in alpha. If you're interested in providing feedback or testing, check out [the multi-backend section below](#multi-backend).

### Supported CUDA Configurations[[cuda-pip]]

The latest version of `bitsandbytes` builds on the following configurations:

| **OS**      | **CUDA Version** | **Compiler**         |
|-------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Linux**   | 11.7 - 12.3      | GCC 11.4             |
|             | 12.4+            | GCC 13.2             |
| **Windows** | 11.7 - 12.4      | MSVC 19.38+ (VS2022) |

For Linux systems, ensure your hardware meets the following requirements:

| **Feature**                     | **Hardware Requirement**                                           |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| LLM.int8()                      | NVIDIA Turing (RTX 20 series, T4) or Ampere (RTX 30 series, A4-A100) GPUs |
| 8-bit optimizers/quantization   | NVIDIA Kepler (GTX 780 or newer)                                    |

> [!WARNING]
> `bitsandbytes >= 0.39.1` no longer includes Kepler binaries in pip installations. This requires [manual compilation using](#cuda-compile) the `cuda11x_nomatmul_kepler` configuration.

To install from PyPI.

```bash
pip install bitsandbytes
```

### `pip install` pre-built wheel from latest `main` commit

If you would like to use new feature even before they are officially released and help us test them, feel free to install the wheel directly from our CI (*the wheel links will remain stable!*):

```
</hfoption>
</hfoptions>

### Compile from source[[cuda-compile]]

> [!TIP]
> Don't hesitate to compile from source! The process is pretty straight forward and resilient. This might be needed for older CUDA versions or other less common configurations, which we don't support out of the box due to package size.

For Linux and Windows systems, compiling from source allows you to customize the build configurations. See below for detailed platform-specific instructions (see the `CMakeLists.txt` if you want to check the specifics and explore some additional options):

<hfoptions id="source">
<hfoption id="Linux">

To compile from source, you need CMake >= **3.22.1** and Python >= **3.8** installed. Make sure you have a compiler installed to compile C++ (`gcc`, `make`, headers, etc.).

For example, to install a compiler and CMake on Ubuntu:

```bash
apt-get install -y build-essential cmake
```

You should also install CUDA Toolkit by following the [NVIDIA CUDA Installation Guide for Linux](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html) guide from NVIDIA. The current expected CUDA Toolkit version is **11.1+** and it is recommended to install **GCC >= 7.3** and required to have at least **GCC >= 6**.

Refer to the following table if you're using another CUDA Toolkit version.

| CUDA Toolkit |  GCC  |
|--------------|-------|
| >= 11.4.1    | >= 11 |
| >= 12.0      | >= 12 |
| >= 12.4      | >= 13 |

Now to install the bitsandbytes package from source, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitsandbytes-foundation/bitsandbytes.git && cd bitsandbytes/
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
cmake -DCOMPUTE_BACKEND=cuda -S .
make
pip install -e .   # `-e` for "editable" install, when developing BNB (otherwise leave that out)
```

> [!TIP]
> If you have multiple versions of CUDA installed or installed it in a non-standard location, please refer to CMake CUDA documentation for how to configure the CUDA compiler.

</hfoption>
<hfoption id="Windows">

Windows systems require Visual Studio with C++ support as well as an installation of the CUDA SDK.

To compile from source, you need CMake >= **3.22.1** and Python >= **3.8** installed. You should also install CUDA Toolkit by following the [CUDA Installation Guide for Windows](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html) guide from NVIDIA.

Refer to the following table if you're using another CUDA Toolkit version.

| CUDA Toolkit | MSVC |
|---|---|
| >= 11.6 | 19.30+ (VS2022) |

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitsandbytes-foundation/bitsandbytes.git && cd bitsandbytes/
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
cmake -DCOMPUTE_BACKEND=cuda -S .
cmake --build . --config Release
pip install -e .   # `-e` for "editable" install, when developing BNB (otherwise leave that out)
```

Big thanks to [wkpark](https://github.com/wkpark), [Jamezo97](https://github.com/Jamezo97), [rickardp](https://github.com/rickardp), [akx](https://github.com/akx) for their amazing contributions to make bitsandbytes compatible with Windows.

### PyTorch CUDA versions[[pytorch-cuda-versions]]

Some bitsandbytes features may need a newer CUDA version than the one currently supported by PyTorch binaries from Conda and pip. In this case, you should follow these instructions to load a precompiled bitsandbytes binary.

1. Determine the path of the CUDA version you want to use. Common paths include:

* `/usr/local/cuda`
* `/usr/local/cuda-XX.X` where `XX.X` is the CUDA version number

Then locally install the CUDA version you need with this script from bitsandbytes:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitsandbytes-foundation/bitsandbytes/main/install_cuda.sh
# Syntax cuda_install CUDA_VERSION INSTALL_PREFIX EXPORT_TO_BASH
#   CUDA_VERSION in {110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125}
#   EXPORT_TO_BASH in {0, 1} with 0=False and 1=True

# For example, the following installs CUDA 11.7 to ~/local/cuda-11.7 and exports the path to your .bashrc

bash install_cuda.sh 117 ~/local 1
```

2. Set the environment variables `BNB_CUDA_VERSION` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` by manually overriding the CUDA version installed by PyTorch.

> [!TIP]
> It is recommended to add the following lines to the `.bashrc` file to make them permanent.

```bash
export BNB_CUDA_VERSION=<VERSION>
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<PATH>
```

For example, to use a local install path:

```bash
export BNB_CUDA_VERSION=117
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/YOUR_USERNAME/local/cuda-11.7
```

3. Now when you launch bitsandbytes with these environment variables, the PyTorch CUDA version is overridden by the new CUDA version (in this example, version 11.7) and a different bitsandbytes library is loaded.

## Multi-backend Support (Alpha Release)[[multi-backend]]

> [!TIP]
> This functionality is currently in preview and not yet production-ready. We very much welcome community feedback, contributions and leadership on topics like Apple Silicon as well as other less common accellerators!

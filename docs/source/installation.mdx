# Installation Guide

Welcome to the installation guide for the `bitsandbytes` library! This document provides step-by-step instructions to install `bitsandbytes` across various platforms and hardware configurations.

We provide official support for NVIDIA GPUs, CPUs, Intel XPUs, and Intel Gaudi platforms. We also have experimental support for
additional platforms such as AMD ROCm.

## System Requirements[[requirements]]

These are the minimum requirements for `bitsandbytes` across all platforms. Please be aware that some compute platforms may impose more strict requirements.

* Python >= 3.9
* PyTorch >= 2.3

## NVIDIA CUDA[[cuda]]

`bitsandbytes` is currently supported on NVIDIA GPUs with [Compute Capability](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) 6.0+.
The library can be built using CUDA Toolkit versions as old as **11.8**.

| **Feature**                     | **CC Required** | **Example Hardware Requirement**            |
|---------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| LLM.int8()                      | 7.5+            | Turing (RTX 20 series, T4) or newer GPUs    |
| 8-bit optimizers/quantization   | 6.0+            | Pascal (GTX 10X0 series, P100) or newer GPUs|
| NF4/FP4 quantization            | 6.0+            | Pascal (GTX 10X0 series, P100) or newer GPUs|


> [!WARNING]
> Support for Maxwell GPUs is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
> Maxwell support is not included in PyPI distributions from `v0.48.0` on and must be built from source.
> For the best results, a Turing generation device or newer is recommended.


### Installation via PyPI[[cuda-pip]]

This is the most straightforward and recommended installation option.

The currently distributed `bitsandbytes` packages are built with the following configurations:

| **OS**             | **CUDA Toolkit** | **Host Compiler**    | **Targets**
|--------------------|------------------|----------------------|--------------

| **Linux x86-64**   | 12.8 - 12.9      | GCC 11.2             | sm70, sm75, sm80, sm86, sm89, sm90, sm100, sm120
| **Linux x86-64**   | 13.0             | GCC 11.2             | sm75, sm80, sm86, sm89, sm90, sm100, sm110, sm120
| **Linux aarch64**  | 11.8 - 12.6      | GCC 11.2             | sm75, sm80, sm90
| **Linux aarch64**  | 12.8 - 13.0      | GCC 11.2             | sm75, sm80, sm90, sm100, sm120
| **Windows x86-64** | 11.8 - 12.6      | MSVC 19.43+ (VS2022) | sm50, sm60, sm75, sm80, sm86, sm89, sm90
| **Windows x86-64** | 12.8 - 12.9      | MSVC 19.43+ (VS2022) | sm70, sm75, sm80, sm86, sm89, sm90, sm100, sm120
| **Windows x86-64** | 13.0             | MSVC 19.43+ (VS2022) | sm75, sm80, sm86, sm89, sm90, sm100, sm120

The Linux build has a minimum glibc version of 2.24.

Use `pip` or `uv` to install the latest release:

```bash
pip install bitsandbytes
```

### Compile from Source[[cuda-compile]]

> [!TIP]
> Don't hesitate to compile from source! The process is pretty straight forward and resilient. This might be needed for older CUDA Toolkit versions or Linux distributions, or other less common configurations.

For Linux and Windows systems, compiling from source allows you to customize the build configurations. See below for detailed platform-specific instructions (see the `CMakeLists.txt` if you want to check the specifics and explore some additional options):

<hfoptions id="source">
<hfoption id="Linux">

To compile from source, you need CMake >= **3.22.1** and Python >= **3.9** installed. Make sure you have a compiler installed to compile C++ (`gcc`, `make`, headers, etc.). It is recommended to use GCC 9 or newer.

For example, to install a compiler and CMake on Ubuntu:

```bash
apt-get install -y build-essential cmake
```

You should also install CUDA Toolkit by following the [NVIDIA CUDA Installation Guide for Linux](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html) guide. The current minimum supported CUDA Toolkit version that we support is **11.8**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitsandbytes-foundation/bitsandbytes.git && cd bitsandbytes/
cmake -DCOMPUTE_BACKEND=cuda -S .
make
pip install -e .   # `-e` for "editable" install, when developing BNB (otherwise leave that out)
```

> [!TIP]
> If you have multiple versions of the CUDA Toolkit installed or it is in a non-standard location, please refer to CMake CUDA documentation for how to configure the CUDA compiler.

</hfoption>
<hfoption id="Windows">

Compilation from source on Windows systems require Visual Studio with C++ support as well as an installation of the CUDA Toolkit.

To compile from source, you need CMake >= **3.22.1** and Python >= **3.9** installed. You should also install CUDA Toolkit by following the [CUDA Installation Guide for Windows](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html) guide from NVIDIA. The current minimum supported CUDA Toolkit version that we support is **11.8**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitsandbytes-foundation/bitsandbytes.git && cd bitsandbytes/
cmake -DCOMPUTE_BACKEND=cuda -S .
cmake --build . --config Release
pip install -e .   # `-e` for "editable" install, when developing BNB (otherwise leave that out)
```

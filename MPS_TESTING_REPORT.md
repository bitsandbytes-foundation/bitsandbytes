## 🎯 Functional Verification

### Device Detection & Selection
```python
# ✅ Working perfectly
hasattr(torch.backends, 'mps') and torch.backends.mps.is_available()  # True
ce.BNB_BACKEND  # "MPS" (correctly selected)
'mps' in bnb.supported_torch_devices  # True
```

### MPS Tensor Operations
```python
# ✅ All operations functional
device = torch.device("mps")
x = torch.randn(16, 16, device=device)  # ✅ Works
y = torch.randn(16, 16, device=device)  # ✅ Works  
z = x @ y  # ✅ Matrix multiplication successful
```

### Backend Import & Loading
```python
# ✅ Clean imports
from bitsandbytes.backends.mps import ops as mps_ops  # ✅ Success
hasattr(mps_ops, '_int8_linear_matmul_impl')  # ✅ True
```

### Error Handling & Fallback
```python
# ✅ Graceful degradation
# When MPS library not compiled:
# - Clear warning message displayed
# - CPU fallback automatically engaged
# - Helpful compilation instructions provided
```

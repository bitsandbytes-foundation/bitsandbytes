          This pre-release contains the latest development wheels for all supported platforms, rebuilt automatically on every commit to the `main` branch.

          **How to install:**
          Pick the correct command for your platform and run it in your terminal:

          ENDOFMARKDOWN

          for whl in wheels/*.whl; do
            fname=$(basename "$whl")

          The version number is replaced with 1.33.7-preview in order to keep the link stable, this however does not affect the installed version at all:
          ```
